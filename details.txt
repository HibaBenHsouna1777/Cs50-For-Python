Hello everyone! 👋

I'm excited to share these folders, dedicated to CS50's Introduction to Python. 🐍✨

📂 Inside, you'll find:
✅ Course materials, neatly divided into sections 📖
✅ Code files with detailed comments explaining each concept 💡
✅ Quizzes and tests from the course to help reinforce learning ✅

As I'm new to this, I hope you find it helpful, and I’d love to hear your feedback! 🚀
